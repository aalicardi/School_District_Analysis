# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to reanalyze standardized test score data following the relevation of cheating amongst ninth graders at Thomas High School. The Math and Reading test scores in this cohort were removed from the data set before reanalyzing. In this project, the following seven metrics are analyzed for the school district: 
1. Top 5 Peforming Schools
2. Bottom 5 Performing Schools
3. Average math score for each grade level at each school
4. Average Reading score for each grade level at each school
5. School performance based on budget per student
6. School performance based on school size
7. School performance based on school type

The findings of this analysis is then compared to the original analysis that was performed prior to the removal of suspected cheating data.
